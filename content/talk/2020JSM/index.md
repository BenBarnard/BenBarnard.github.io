summary: R, Python,.... Julia???? which should we choose?
abstract: "R, Python,.... Julia???? which should we choose? To make things more difficult and confusing we compare the history of the languages and the decisions that have been made in their respective development. We also compare the history and development of SAS, STAT, Minitab, etc and what influence these software might have had on the development of the previous open source tools. Topics include the tidyverse and pandas movement, Hmisc?, what is the deal with Python 2.x and 3.x. Why did someone decide we needed another open source language out there... Julia I am looking at you. We hope to embrace the differences among the languages and avoid all out war."
