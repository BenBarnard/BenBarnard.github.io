summary: Reduce organization risk, improve business continuity, and increase development time of internal R packages.
abstract: "We talk about building a sustainable infrastructure of R packages that are maintained, developed and driven by the organizational analytic community. How do we create this community, where do we find the needed tools, and how do we persuade leadership are discussed with some recommendations. In addition, we discuss how this structure can reduce organization risk, improve business continuity, and increase development time. Finally, when can we step away and let it grow on its own?"
