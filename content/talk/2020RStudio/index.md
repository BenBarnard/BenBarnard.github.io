summary: Why did we do that analysis for them?
abstract: "A collection of data science stories about current problems that data scientists might face while working in academia, industry, and government. Some lessons learned, some situations avoided, what I learned, and how I survived my journey. First, I discuss the struggle of advocating for R when senior leaders decide Python is the only appropriate product. Then, I describe why donut charts are superior to pie charts, and why we should all be using them. Finally, the case of the un-catchable 'drive-by' stakeholder and where to find them. The fight is real, and the path is long for the evangelical data scientist."
